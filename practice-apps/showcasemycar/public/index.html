	<META NAME="Description" CONTENT="Next Generation of Maruti Suzuki Swift is going to lanuch in Feb 2018 in India. It is built on HEARTECT platform and will be available in both Petrol and Diesel engine options. It is going to come with 1.0 litre turbocharged BoosterJet Petrol option.">
	<META NAME="Classification" CONTENT="The new generation Swift gets a completely new styling and looks more upmarket than its predecessor. The A-pillar accentuates the Swift's trademark styling but the front grille is new and the new sweptback headlamp looks sleek and incorporates LED DRLs give it a sporty look. On the engine front, Suzuki is yet to reveal the powertrains but we expect the 1.0 litre turbocharged BoosterJet petrol, updated 1.2 litre K-Series petrol and 1.3 litre diesel to make their way under the hood. Transmission options will include the 5-speed manual and automatic units - though Maruti may consider the AMTs for both petrol and diesel models in India. ">
